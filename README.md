# Connect4

# Scope of project
This project is part of my special topic/project course at the University of Thessaly, for the winter semester of 2016-2017.
The goal of this project was to design and implement a clone of the connect4 game on the Android platform , that would also support online gameplay.

# General description
The game offers the user the chance to compete against the Artificial intelligence in offline matches or against other players in online matches. It consists of two parts , the client and the server.
The client is used for offline and online matches. It shows a start menu when launching the app, where the user can adjust game settings, like the game difficulty in offline matches. After choosing a game mode, the actual game field is shown to the user.
The server handles user authentication , matchmaking and the game flow in online multiplayer matches.

# Tools used for development
 - [Android studio latest version (2.1 during development)](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
 - [Genymotion emulator for Android] (https://www.genymotion.com/)
